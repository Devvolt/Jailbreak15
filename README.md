# Jailbreak15
A jailbreak tool for iOS 15.

This tool is a "shortcut-based" jailbreak. At this point it is useless beacuse need a kernel exploit.
It can be called as a "simulation" of a possible jailbreak. To run it you need to enable the untrusted shortcuts execution function on shortcut app settings.
